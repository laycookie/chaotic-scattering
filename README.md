# Intro

This project focuses on learning Rust and wasm-pack while showcasing the generation of a random number using chaotic scattering. It demonstrates how to run Rust code on the web by compiling it to WebAssembly (Wasm) using wasm-pack.
The repository consists of two projects: chaotic-scattering_website, which contains the website, and chaotic-scattering_library, which houses Rust functions for calculating the random number based on chaotic scattering.

### The following repository results in a website that you can view [here](https://front-end-chaos.vercel.app/)
